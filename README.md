### Each of the folders futures an algorithm as a stand alone project
* Astart - path finding algorithm
* tsp genetic algorithm with cross over
  - heuristic approach to travelling sales person problem using fitness score, mutation and cross-over 
  - You can add actual addresses that will be geocoded and the optimal order is returned
  - You will need to add a google API key to your .env file
* tsp lexiographic oder - brutal force approach by running over each possible combination to solve the travelling sales person
* breadth first search algorithm
  - Traversing a graph of nodes by exploring all neighbours first and then moving on to the next level
  - In this example connections between actors can be found. 
* binary search tree
  - a binary search tree holding numbers on each node. Tree can be traversed and searched for a specific value
